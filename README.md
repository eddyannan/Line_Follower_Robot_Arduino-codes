The primary objective of this project was to further augment my practical knowledge and comprehension of mechatronic systems by developing an innovative application. The outcome is an autonomous robot capable of detecting and accurately following a designated colored line on surfaces of varying contrast, including scenarios where a black line is painted on a white background. By seamlessly integrating concepts and components from the field of mechatronics, this project showcases the fusion of mechanics, electronics, and programming to achieve precise line-tracking capabilities, pushing the boundaries of autonomous robotic systems.
